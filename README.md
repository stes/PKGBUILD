This is a loose collection of PKGBUILDs for Arch Linux package I did not find in the AUR.
Please check the AUR first to see if a new package version is available before you use
one of my PKGBUILDs.

Currently available package:

- gtts  
- nest
- sloth
- python-mne
- python-pyedflib

Python packages are usually created using the [pip2arch](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pip2arch-git/) utility.
